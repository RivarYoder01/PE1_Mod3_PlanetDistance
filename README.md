# CSC 365 Paired Programming #2 Planet_Distances
## Written by: Rivar Yoder and Caleb Jenkinson 
### The user will input a number 1-8 (0 to exit the program) that coorisponds to a planet on the presented menu. 
### The program will then take the two planets and subtract their distances from eachother, giving that number back to the user. 
### A loop will allow the user to keep putting in planets to find the distance.
### [Planet information](https://www.universetoday.com/15462/how-far-are-the-planets-from-the-sun/) for project, average distance used.

### **What was Learned**
* While and for loops
* Nested while loops
* Docstrings for every function
* Metadata and version declairation at the beginning of the program
* Error handeling for out of range numbers and not numeric variables
* Keeping consistant variables
* Tuples that require unpacking
* Absolute functions
* Tab based error handling
